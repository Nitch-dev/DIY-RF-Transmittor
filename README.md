# DIY-RF-Transmittor
a simple RF transmitter capable of broadcasting audio signals. The transmitter utilizes an XR-2206 IC to modulate an audio signal onto a carrier wave. The modulated signal is then transmitted through a simple antenna. The receiver can be any AM radio capable of picking up the transmitted frequency. which right now is my old Car.
